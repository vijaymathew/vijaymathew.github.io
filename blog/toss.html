    <p>Random generation of events is important for modeling many statistical processes. In this post we will discuss
      how to simulate the tossing of an unbiased coin in Clojure. We will do this using pure functional techniques.
      We will also write functions to derive some interesting statistics from coin-toss experiments.

    <h2>Simulating Coin Tosses</h2>

    <p>A coin toss can result in either a head or a tail. We shall assign the integer <code>1</code> to head and <code>0</code> to tail,
      so that we can use the <code>rand-int</code> function to simulate a single toss.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
> (<span class="kw">defn</span> toss [] (rand-int 2))
> (toss)	  
<span class="comment">;;=> will output 1 or 0 with equal chance. probability=0.5</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>How can we simulate <code>N</code> tosses? With the help
      of <a href="http://clojure-doc.org/articles/language/laziness.html" target="_blank">lazy sequences</a>.
      The following function will give us as many tosses as we want!</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
> (<span class="kw">defn</span> tosses []
    (<span class="kw">lazy-seq</span> (cons (toss) (tosses))))

> (take 10 (tosses))
<span class="comment">;;=> (1 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1)</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <h2>Functional Inquiry</h2>

    <p>Now we would want to answer some questions about the data gathered from all those tosses, like how many heads were generated
      by the experiment? The higher-order function <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/reduce" target="_blank"><code>reduce</code></a>
      can help us here:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
> (reduce + 0 (take 10 (tosses)))
<span class="comment">;;=> 5</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p><b>Note</b> You may get a different result, as the simulation includes random values.</p>

    <p>It is well-known that the ratio of the number of heads (or tails) to the total number of tosses will approach <code>0.5</code> as
      the number of tosses increases. To test this out, we first need a version of <code>reduce</code> that returns a sequence of cumulative
      results. The definition of this function follows:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
(<span class="kw">defn</span> cumulate [f init xs]
  (<span class="kw">when</span> (seq xs)
    (<span class="kw">let</span> [r (f init (first xs))]
      (<span class="kw">lazy-seq</span> (cons r (cumulate f r (rest xs)))))))
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p><code>Cumulate</code> applies the function <code>f</code> to <code>init</code> and the first element of <code>xs</code>.
      The result (<code>r</code>) becomes the head of a lazy sequence. The tail of this sequence is constructed by
      a recursive call to <code>cumulate</code> with <code>r</code> being the value of <code>init</code>. This process continues
      until <code>xs</code> runs out of values. The returned sequence will contain all intermediate results of the reduction of <code>xs</code>
      by <code>f</code>.</p>

    <p>Let's call <code>reduce</code> and <code>cumulate</code> on the same inputs and see how the outputs differ:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
> (reduce + 0 [1 2 3 4 5])
<span class="comment">;;=> 15</span>
> (cumulate + 0 [1 2 3 4 5])
<span class="comment">;;=> (1 3 6 10 15)</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>The value returned by <code>reduce</code> and the final value in the sequence returned by <code>cumulate</code> are the same.
      In addition, <code>cumulate</code> also captures the intermediate values of the reduction.</p>

    <p>Cumulative summing of sequences can be expressed by the following partial application of <code>cumulate</code>:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
> (<span class="kw">def</span> sums (partial cumulate + 0))
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>We have all the tools necessary to experiment and find out if heads appear with a probability of <code>0.5</code> if a coin is
      tossed for a sufficiently large number of times. The following program will conduct this experiment for us:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
> (<span class="kw">def</span> xs (take 3000 (tosses)))
> (<span class="kw">def</span> ss (sums xs))
> (<span class="kw">def</span> rs (map #(/ (float %1) %2) ss (range 1 3001)))
> (drop 2500 rs)
<span class="comment">;;=> (0.5041983206717313 0.504396482813749 0.5041949660407511 ...)
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>First, <code>3000</code> tosses are made. The number of heads seen until each toss is found by calling <code>sums</code>.
      The higher-order function <code>map</code> walks down this sequence, dividing each entry by the corresponding toss number
      to produce a sequence of ratios.</p>

    <p>As we see in the final output, the ratio of heads indeed approach <code>0.5</code>.</p>

    <p>There are other interesting information that we can derive from the data returned by <code>tosses</code>.
      For instance, can you design a function to report the excess of heads over tails for a particular toss?</p>

    <p>This problem can be solved by finding the difference between the cumulative number of heads and the cumulative number of tails
      for the specified toss. We can find the cumulative of tails by first "inverting" the tosses and then applying <code>sums</code> to
      the result. Here is the invert function:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
> (<span class="kw">defn</span> inv [xs]
    (map #(if (zero? %) 1 0) xs))

> (<span class="kw">def</span> xs (take 10 (tosses)))
> xs
<span class="comment">;;=> (0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0)</span>

> (<span class="kw">def</span> ys (inv xs))
> ys
<span class="comment">;;=> (1 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1)</span>

      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>The function <code>excess</code> defined below, finds the difference between a sequence and its inverse:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
> (<span class="kw">defn</span> excess [xs n]
    (<span class="kw">let</span> [hs (sums xs)
	  ts (sums (inv xs))]
      (nth (map #(- %1 %2) hs ts) n)))

> (excess xs 4)
<span class="comment">;;=> -1</span>
> (excess xs 5)
<span class="comment">;;=> 0</span>
> (excess xs 6)
<span class="comment">;;=> -1</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p><b>Exercise 1</b> Write a function to report the first <code>n</code> excesses of tails over heads.</p>
    <p><b>Exercise 2</b> Use <a href="http://incanter.org/" target="_blank">Incanter</a> to visualize the various
      information you gather about coin tosses. To start, you may plot the ratios obtained from the first 3000 tosses.</p>
