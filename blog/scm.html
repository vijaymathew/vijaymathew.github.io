    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_%28programming_language%29" target="_blank">Scheme</a> is a masterpiece of minimalism in
      programming language design. Despite being a simple language, it has amazing expressive power. Its most widely
      implemented <a href="https://schemers.org/Documents/Standards/R5RS/r5rs.pdf" target="_blank">standard</a> is only 50 pages
      long and can be read over a weekend. This post is an attempt to find out the secret to Scheme's minimal but effective design.
      It is hoped that the insights gained should be applicable to system design problems in general.</p>

    <h2>Lambda the Powerful!</h2>

    <p>First-class functions are the primary means of abstraction in Scheme. A function can be passed as an argument to other functions,
      can be created at will and can be stored in data structures. A function can also make
      unbounded number of iterative calls to itself or to other functions. This is possible because Scheme implementations are required
      to optimize <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call" target="_blank">tail calls</a>.
      This enable programmers to use tail recursion for expressing iteration.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
<span class="comment">;; Sum the elements in a list, utilizing tail recursion.</span>

(<span class="kw">define</span> (sum-list xs sum)
  (<span class="kw">if</span> (null? xs)
    sum
    (sum-list (cdr xs) (+ (car xs) sum))))

(sum-list '(1 2 3 4 5) 0)
<span class="comment">;;=> 15</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>We can redefine <code>sum-list</code> as a general "list reducer". The operation used to combine the elements of the list together
      into a single value can be passed as a functional argument:</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
(<span class="kw">define</span> (reduce xs init opr)
  (<span class="kw">if</span> (null? xs)
  init
  (reduce (cdr xs) (opr (car xs) init) opr)))

<span class="comment">;; Same as sum-list</span>
(reduce '(1 2 3 4 5) 0 +)
<span class="comment">;;=> 15</span>

(reduce '(1 2 3 4 5) 1 *)
<span class="comment">;;=> 120</span>

(<span class="kw">define</span> (square x) (* x x))

(reduce '(1 2 3 4 5) 1 (<span class="kw">lambda</span> (x y) (+ (square x) (square y))))
<span class="comment">;;=> 28569050</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>Tail call optimization makes it unnecessary to bake-in looping constructs like <code>for</code> and <code>while</code> into the core
      of the language.</p>

    <h2>Lexical Scope</h2>

    <p>Scheme was one of the earliest languages to support lexical scoping of variables. This means, all variable bind to the values given
      to them in the context they were defined. These bindings do not change even when the expressions are evaluated in other parts of the
      program.</p>
    <p>The following program demonstrates the possibilities offered by lexical scoping. It defines a function
      that returns another function. The returned function can refer to the variable bindings in its defining context, even when
      it is invoked from other contexts.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
(<span class="kw">define</span> (make-adder base)
  (<span class="kw">lambda</span> (x) (+ base x)))

(<span class="kw">define</span> a5 (make-adder 5))
(<span class="kw">define</span> a10 (make-adder 10))
(a5 20)
<span class="comment">;;=> 25</span>
(a10 20)
<span class="comment">;;=> 30</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>The combination of first-class functions and lexical scoping allows Scheme to express object-based programs. No special syntax or
      language construct is required to use this powerful paradigm.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
(<span class="kw">define</span> (make-cat)
  (<span class="kw">lambda</span> (message)
    (<span class="kw">case</span> message
      ((say-hello) <span class="sym">'meow</span>))))

(<span class="kw">define</span> (make-dog)
  (<span class="kw">lambda</span> (message)
    (<span class="kw">case</span> message
      ((say-hello) <span class="sym">'bow-wow</span>))))

(<span class="kw">define</span> c (make-cat))
(c <span class="sym">'say-hello</span>)
<span class="comment">;;=> meow</span>
(<span class="kw">define</span> d (make-dog))
(d <span class="sym">'say-hello</span>)
<span class="comment">;;=> bow-wow</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    (<a href="./func.html" target="_blank">Read more</a> about functional abstractions).

    <h2>Syntactic Abstractions</h2>

    <p>It is quite impressive that a combination of a few simple concepts is enough to program in multiple paradigms. But sometimes the
      programs written might need a more natural syntax. For instance, programs will become shorter and easier to maintain if there is
      syntactic support for defining classes of objects. Instead of building in syntax for all possible paradigms, Scheme (like other Lisps)
      allow users to extend the language syntax by a macro system. Scheme's macro system is even more powerful because
      the code generated by a macro is guaranteed to be
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygienic_macro" target="_blank">hygienic</a>. The Scheme macro system respects the lexical
      scoping of the rest of the language. This is assured by special naming and scoping rules for macro expansion and avoids
      common programming errors that can occur in the macro systems of other programming languages. The macro system is also very expressive
      because it makes use of a simple pattern matching sub-language.</p>

    <p>Let us extend Scheme to support a language for defining new classes of objects. This extension will add a new construct to
      the language called <code>define-class</code>. It takes the class name and a list of messages and message handlers as
      arguments. The Scheme macro expander will transform a <code>define-class</code> to a function definition that takes a symbolic
      message as argument and execute the appropriate message implementation.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
(<span class="kw">define-syntax</span> define-class
  (<span class="kw">syntax-rules</span> ()
    ((define-class class-name ((message-name message-body) ...))
     (<span class="kw">define</span> (class-name)
       (<span class="kw">lambda</span> (message)
	 (<span class="kw">case</span> message
	   ((message-name) message-body)
	   ...
	   (<span class="kw">else</span> (error <span class="str">"invalid message"</span> message))))))))

(<span class="kw">define-class</span> cat ((say-hello <span class="sym">'meow</span>)))
(<span class="kw">define-class</span> dog ((say-hello <span class="sym">'bow-wow</span>)))

(<span class="kw">define</span> c (cat))
(<span class="kw">define</span> d (dog))

(c <span class="sym">'say-hello</span>)
<span class="comment">;;=> meow</span>
(d <span class="sym">'say-hello</span>)
<span class="comment">;;=> bow-wow</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p><strong>Exercise 1</strong>: Add attribute support for classes defined by <code>define-class</code>. For instance, it should be possible to
      assign names to the various animal objects, like - <code>(define c (cat 'sassy))</code>. It should also be possible to refer and
      update the attributes through messages, e,g: </p>
    <p><pre><code>(c 'name) ;;=> sassy
(c 'set-name 'Kitty)
(c 'name) ;;=> Kitty</code></pre></p>

    <p>Let us conclude this section with one more example. We will define a macro that will behave like the
      <code>while</code> loop found in most imperative languages. Notice how the macro compiles the loop to a tail-recursive function.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
(<span class="kw">define-syntax</span> while
  (<span class="kw">syntax-rules</span> ()
    ((while condition body ...)
     (<span class="kw">begin</span>
       (<span class="kw">define</span> (loop)
	 (<span class="kw">if</span> condition
	     (<span class="kw">begin</span>
                body ...
	       (loop))))
        (loop)))))

<span class="comment">;; Usage:</span>
(<span class="kw">define</span> i 0)
(while (&lt; i 5)
  (display <span class="str">"hello\n"</span>)
  (set! i (+ i 1)))
<span class="comment">;;-> hello
     hello
     hello
     hello
     hello</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    (<a href="./syn.html" target="_blank">Read more</a> about building syntactic abstractions in Lisp).

    <h2>Control-flow Abstractions</h2>

    <p>The previous sections showed how a pragmatic language can be designed on top of only a couple of simple building blocks.
      First-class functions and macros can be combined together in intuitive ways to extend and adapt the language to suit
      almost any problem domain. But Scheme does not stop there! It also allows the programmer to get access to the control state of
      the program and add extensions to the language that control the way the program execution flows. It is possible to capture
      the current state of control flow as a function. If this function is called from another part of the program, control will go back
      to the point where it was captured and the program will continue executing from there.</p>

    <p>The presence of first-class <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation" target="_blank">continuations</a>
      means Scheme do not need built-in support for features like exceptions and coroutines.
      These can be added to the language as libraries.</p>

    <p>We will conclude this post with two examples of using continuations. The first one shows the implementation of a simple coroutine
      mechanism.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
(<span class="kw">define</span> continue <span class="pw">#f</span>)

(<span class="kw">define</span> (f)
  (display <span class="str">"f: hello\n"</span>)
  (<span class="kw">call/cc</span>
   (<span class="kw">lambda</span> (k)
     (set! continue k)
     (g)))
  (display <span class="str">"bye bye!\n"</span>))

(<span class="kw">define</span> (g)
  (display <span class="str">"g: hello\n"</span>)
  (continue))

(f)
<span class="comment">;;-> f: hello
;;-> g: hello
;;-> bye bye!</span>
      </code></pre>
    </div>

    <p>The continuation captured in the function <code>f</code> allows the function <code>g</code> to restart <code>f</code> from where it
      left off. This code can become the basis for a more feature-full multitasking library.</p>

    <p><strong>Exercise 2</strong>: Read about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model" target="_blank">Actor model</a>
      of computation and write an implementation for Scheme.
      Look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Erlang</a> for inspiration!
      You can find some guidance on actual implementation
      <a href="https://www.scheme.com/tspl4/examples.html#./examples:h11" target="_blank">here</a> and
      <a href="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~gambit/doc/gambit.html#Threads" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <p>The second example combines continuations with functions and macros to implement an exception handling mechanism.
      Basically, the error handlers are continuations which are made to replace the current state of program execution when an
      exception is raised.</p>

    <div class="prog">
      <pre><code>
(<span class="kw">define</span> handlers '())

(<span class="kw">define</span> (top-handler)
  (car handlers))

(<span class="kw">define</span> (pop-handlers!)
  (<span class="kw">if</span> (not (null? handlers))
      (set! handlers (cdr handlers))))

(<span class="kw">define</span> no-handlers? null?)

(<span class="kw">define</span> (exception msg)
  (<span class="kw">if</span> (no-handlers? handlers)
      (error msg)
      (<span class="kw">let</span> ((handler (top-handler)))
	(handler (cons <span class="sym">'error</span> msg)))))

(<span class="kw">define</span> (prepare-handler handler)
  (pop-handlers!)
  (<span class="kw">lambda</span> (obj)
    (<span class="kw">if</span> (<span class="kw">and</span> (pair? obj) (eq? <span class="sym">'error</span> (car obj)))
	(handler obj)
	obj)))

(<span class="kw">define-syntax</span> with-handler
  (<span class="kw">syntax-rules</span> ()
    ((with-handler handler body ...)
     ((prepare-handler handler)
      (<span class="kw">call/cc</span>
       (<span class="kw">lambda</span> (k)
	 (set! handlers (cons k handlers))
	 body
	 ...))))))

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Scheme is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego" target="_blank">Lego</a> of the programming world.
      Strict, first-class functions with lexically scoped variable bindings
      are the primary building material here. We combine and compose them in various patterns to build abstractions of immense power.
      These abstractions can be constructed fast because the semantics of function definition and application is
      simple to understand and easy to reason about.
      These abstractions will normally have <a href="https://ecraven.github.io/r7rs-benchmarks/" target="_blank">good performance</a>
      because most Scheme implementations take special care to optimize function calls. Add hygienic macros and continuations to the toolbox
      and we have unlimited power at our disposal. Scheme allows us to build the right abstractions at the right level and write code in
      a language tailor-made for the problem at hand. Indeed Scheme is a triumph of minimalism in language design and engineering!</p>
