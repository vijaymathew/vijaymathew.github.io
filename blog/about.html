    <h1>About</h1>

    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Lisp</a> is a family of general-purpose,
      high-level programming languages.
      Lisp was originally specified almost 60 years ago and is still widely used today.
      Lisp <a href="http://paulgraham.com/diff.html" target="_blank">pioneered important ideas</a> in modern programming language design and has
      left more recent languages behind to play catch-up.</p>
    
    <p><a href="index.html">Lisp Chronicles</a> publish programming tutorials and articles with a slant
      towards <a href="https://clojure.org/" target="_blank">Clojure</a> and
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)" target="_blank">Scheme</a>, two modern dialects of Lisp.</p>

    <p>Lisp Chronicles is brought to you by <a href="http://schemer.in">Vijay Mathew Pandyalakal</a>, a software developer located in India.</p>
